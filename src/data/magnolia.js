      `Magnolia is the esteemed daughter of an aristocratic family. Her father, Clint, was once a humble merchant before marrying Viscountess Liora, a woman of grace and strength.`,

      `They quickly connected and fell in love, leading to Magnolia's birth. While they were joyful about their family, tragedy struck when her mother died during childbirth.`,

      `Her father felt abandoned and burdened by the loss of his wife and the child who survived. This led him to harbor resentment toward both his late wife and Magnolia. As a result, Magnolia grew up feeling lonely and neglected by her father.`,

      `Although Magnolia grew up facing mistreatment and a lack of affection from her father, she eventually accepted this way of life, as she was taught etiquette and received a good education.`,

      `After all, no child of his should be uneducated or foolish.`,

      `Since then, Magnolia's father became entirely focused on his business, gaining fame throughout Fontaine. However, his tendency to earn and recklessly spend money developed into a bad habit, leading him to earn a notorious reputation for gambling and extravagant spending. His greed for wealth and luxury resulted in mounting debts.`,

      `As the lavish lifestyle he craved began to crumble, he found himself trapped in a web of financial struggle. Desperate to maintain appearances, he foolishly decided to mortgage their estate, believing that a quick influx of cash would solve his problems. However, this reckless choice only deepened the crisis, jeopardizing not just their home but the very legacy of his family.`,

      `"This is all I need..." she tells herself daily, unaware that she's deceiving herself. Each time she utters those words, a flicker of doubt lingers in the back of her mind, but she pushes it aside. She convinces herself that her life of solitude is sufficient, that her love for music and her quiet existence can fill the void in her heart.`,

      `Yet, beneath her calm facade, a storm brews. She knows her father blames her for her mother's death and often reminds her of it.`,

      `"Liora died because of you," he says, pointing a finger at Magnolia's face. Whenever her father acts this way, she stares at him blankly, resembling a lifeless doll.`,

      `Although she would be lying if she claimed his words didn't hurt, she has learned to maintain a stoic expression over the years. He revels in belittling her, using her mother's death as a weapon to control and demean her, making it clear that he sees her as nothing more than a burden.`,

      `Her only escape was through playing the violin, where her passion flourished and her profound love for music took root.`,

      `Deep down, she longs for connection, for understanding, and for a life where she is not just surviving but truly living.`,

      `As the days pass, she fights with the tension between her acceptance and her unacknowledged desires.`,

      `As debts piled up and her father gradually lost his property and belongings, all that remained for him was his daughter, Magnolia.`,

      `The wealthy man who purchased the estate cornered Magnolia's father, relentlessly pressuring him to settle his debts. Realizing he had no means to pay, the man made a chilling offer: he would return the estate in exchange for his daughter, assuring him that he wouldn't owe anything further. Hesitant but contemplating, a broad smile spread across his face as he asked, "I really won't have to pay anything?"`,

      `"Indeed," the man replied. Thus, Magnolia was married off. Initially, she hoped this marriage would be her escape and a fresh start, but she quickly realized it was no different from her life with her father.`,

      `In her first year of marriage, the expectations of being a wife were forced upon her, compelling her to do things against her will, stripping away her sense of autonomy and hope for a brighter future. Magnolia conceived a child under the weight of coercion. With her fragile mind and body overwhelmed, her child arrived too soon, and tragically, it did not survive.`,

      `The once lifeless Magnolia was now consumed by sorrow and resentment toward her husband. The child, who could have been her only salvation, was lost to her as well. The loss deepened her despair, leaving a haunting emptiness that echoed her struggles.`,

      `Playing the violin became her sanctuary once again, a place where she could express her pain and seek solace.`,

      `Instead of comforting a mother who had just lost her child, her husband continued to mistreat and neglect her needs, his cruel sarcasm dismissing her grief with a cold indifference that felt like a dagger to her heart.`,

      `Each cutting remark and icy glare shattered her already fragile spirit, leaving her feeling utterly alone and worthless. Day and night, Magnolia was tormented by constant nightmares, her mind filled with dark thoughts of revenge. Each restless hour heightened her yearning to make him suffer as she had.`,

      `Driven by this obsession, she began searching for a solution that would gradually weaken him. Over the course of time, she meticulously put a subtle poison onto his meals, carefully observing its effects as it slowly wrecked his body, robbing him of strength and vitality. Each small dose felt like a step closer to her revenge. As the poison spread throughout his limbs, he became bedridden and unable to move.`,

      `"How does it feel to be helpless?" she asked, looking down at him.`,

      `His eyes widened in realization, fear coursing through him as he saw Magnolia set his sheets on fire.`,

      `"PLEASE! Don't do this, Magnolia!" he cried, the room filled with his desperate pleas and the stench of burning flesh.`,

      `For the first time, she felt free. Magnolia stood at the foot of the burning bed, tears streaming down her cheeks as she watched the flames engulf everything, waiting for the smoke to take her away.`,

      `She felt a sense of happiness.`,

      `One of the gardes patrolling the area noticed the fire and quickly sprang into action to prevent it from spreading throughout Fontaine. Upon entering, the garde found the unconscious Magnolia lying on the floor and immediately provided her with immediate help.`,

      `Following the investigation regarding the fire that broke out, the Marechaussee Phantom uncovered her elaborate year-long plan through evidence of her research, her notes, and forensic evidence from her husband's body. Testimonies from their workers revealed that Magnolia's husband had been abusive, which ultimately led her to kill him.`,

      `As a result, she was arrested and set to stand trial at the Opera Epiclese. Upon trial, Magnolia was found guilty by the Oratrice mecanique d'analyse cardinale and the Chief Justice, who declared that her actions, while understandable given the circumstances, could not go unpunished.`,

      `The court recognized the depth of her suffering but emphasized that taking a life, even in revenge, was a grave offense. Consequently, she was sentenced to a long-term imprisonment in the Fortress of Meropide.`,

      `As she was led away, Magnolia felt a mix of relief and despair. Though she would spend decades in the Fortress, she held onto a flicker of hope that this time could be a chance for a change.`,

      `In her solitude, she vowed to emerge stronger, ready to reclaim her life and seek justice for herself in a world that had shown her little mercy.`,

      `Spending decades in the Fortress has been a breath of fresh air for Magnolia; she has made a few friends along the way. Thanks to the melusine head nurse who cared for her both physically and mentally, Magnolia slowly became brighter.`,

      `"Magnolia told me that if she could give birth again, she hoped her child would look as adorable as me," the head nurse said, sadness creeping into her voice. "But that won't be possible, as she can't have a child anymore." The head nurse felt a deep sympathy for her.`,

      `Knowing Magnolia needed companionship, the head nurse often invited her to hang out in her office after work, giving her check-ups and a safe space to unwind. Their time together became a cherished routine filled with tea, conversation, music, and mutual care, slowly filling Magnolia's heart again.`,

      `Yet, despite these moments of joy, she sometimes found herself haunted by thoughts of her lost child. Remembering her brought tears to her eyes, and on nights when she tossed and turned in bed, she would cry herself to sleep. One evening, as she lay restless, she felt something under her pillow.`,

      `It was a vision.`,

      `Magnolia felt neither happiness nor excitement. Instead, one overwhelming question consumed her thoughts: "What did I do to deserve this?" It was a question for which she had no answer, leaving her in a state of confusion.`,

      `As her sentence ended, Magnolia's life began to brighten, allowing her to step into the music scene where she happily performed for audiences. One day, while strolling outside, she stumbled upon the Chief Justice, who seemed to be taking a rare break.`,

      `"Monsieur Neuvillette?" she called out as she approached him.`,

      `"Ah, it's you! You look happier. I assume you're well adjusted to your life here," the Iudex replied, greeting her with a warm smile. "Congratulations," he added, noticing her vision.`,

      `"....Why do the gods bless me with it?" Magnolia asked, her voice tinged with confusion. A heavy silence fell between them. The sky suddenly turned grey.`,

      `"Perhaps," he mused, "it's a mark that those nightmares from your past are gone and that you're finally free from all of it. You have fought so hard, Magnolia, and this vision may be a sign of your resilience. It symbolizes a new beginning, a chance to embrace the future without the shadows of what once haunted you."`,

      `He paused, his gaze steady on her. "Embrace this gift, let it guide you forward. You deserve to find joy and fulfillment after all you've endured." Magnolia tearfully smiled at the Iudex, feeling as if her question had finally found an answer. A wave of relief washed over her.`,

      `The sky cleared.`,
